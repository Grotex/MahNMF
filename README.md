# MahNMF

Manhattan non-negative matrix factorization(MahNMF) is an extension of non-negative matrix factorization(NMF).
Itminimizes the Manhattan distance between $X$ and $W^TH$ for modeling the heavy tailed Laplacian noise 
and robustly estimates the low-rank part and the sparse part of a non-negative matrix and thus performs effectively 
when data are contaminated by outliers.
